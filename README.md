# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammed Alsheakh

I graduated with a B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering from the Faculty of Technology at Marmara University, where the program was taught 100% in Turkish. 
I’m passionate about Control Systems and Power Electronics, and I love combining hardware and software to build real systems.
